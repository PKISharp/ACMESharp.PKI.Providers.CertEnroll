# ACMESharp.PKI.Providers.CertEnroll

PKI Tool provider for the [ACMESharp](https://github.com/ebekker/ACMESharp)
project based on Windows Cert Enroll API.  THIS COMPONENT IS INCOMPLETE.

NOTE:  this project was originally a direct part of the ACMESharp solution,
but because development stagnated and the component was not maintained any
longer, it has been pulled out into its own separate project in case anyone
has any use for it in the future.
